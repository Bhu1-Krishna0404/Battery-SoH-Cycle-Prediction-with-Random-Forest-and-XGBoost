# Battery SoH & Cycle Prediction with Random Forest and XGBoost

**Machine Learning-driven Flask application for real-time EV battery State of Health (SoH) and remaining cycle prediction.**

---

## 📘 Abstract

Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption is rapidly increasing, requiring efficient and reliable battery management systems, especially in battery swapping infrastructures.  
This project presents a **Machine Learning-driven Flask web application** for **real-time battery health estimation**, enhancing the efficiency of EV battery swapping systems.

The system predicts two critical parameters of battery condition: **State of Health (SoH)** and **remaining charge cycles**.  
It uses **Random Forest Regression** and **XGBoost**, trained on historical battery usage data including charge/discharge current, voltage, temperature, and cycle counts.

The application processes user input in real time and displays the battery’s health status via a user-friendly interface, enabling swift decision-making at swapping stations.  
This solution supports proactive maintenance, optimal battery utilization, and sustainable EV practices by reducing premature battery disposal.
